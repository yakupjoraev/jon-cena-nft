            Hi, my name is John Cena! I've been collecting NFTs for a long time and I'm sure there's a future behind
            them.
            Everyone knows I love my fans and sometimes have different giveaways. Today I decided to give you the unique
            opportunity to own a part of my legacy and get NFTs for FREE
          </p>

            Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) seem to be everywhere these days.
            <br> From art and music to tacos and toilet
            paper,
            these digital assets are selling like 17th-century exotic Dutch tulipsâ€”some for millions of dollars.
            <br>
            It is fairly evident that blockchain technology is changing the future of trade.
            <br>This will include Bitcoins
            as
            well as digital assets such as NFTs. <br>
            We have just gotten started in crypto art and if top players in art and
            fashion start participating in this space then it will most definitely explode.
